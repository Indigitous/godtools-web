        and man is sinful.  A great gulf separates the two.  The arrows illustrate
        that man is continually trying to reach God and the abundant life through
        his own efforts, such as a good life, philosophy, or religion, but he inevitably
        fails.

        God; but, because of his own stubborn self-will, he chose to go his own independent
        way and fellowship with God was broken.  This self-will, characterized by
        an attitude of active rebellion or passive indifference, is an evidence of
        what the Bible calls sin.

        caboose.  In the same way, as Christians we do not depend on feelings or emotions,
        but we place our faith (trust) in the trustworthiness of God and the promises
        of His Word.

        the Son of God does not have the life.  These things I have written to you

        from the very moment you invite Him in.  He will not deceive you.
